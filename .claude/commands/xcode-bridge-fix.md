description: Analyze Xcode build errors and fix them systematically
---

Please analyze the Xcode build logs and errors in `/Users/bytedance/.tiktok_ai_infra/xcode_statusline_logs.json` and provide a comprehensive report.

If build errors are found:
1. Create a todo list with all the issues that need to be fixed
2. Work through each issue systematically, one by one
3. Mark each todo as completed when fixed
4. Provide a summary of what was fixed

If no errors are found, provide a brief status report confirming the build is clean.
